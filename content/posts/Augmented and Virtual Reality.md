What is AR VR:
AR is combination of the real world and computer-generated content.
VR is a computer-based system that uses software, screens on each eye, and interactive controls to allow a person to enter a virtual, digital world.

How does it work:
The goal here is to create what appears to be a life size, 3D virtual environment without the boundaries we usually associate with TV or computer screens. So whatever way you look, the screen mounted to your face follows you. Virtual reality immerses you in a virtual world through the use of a headset with some type of screen displaying a virtual environment. These headsets also use a technology called head tracking, which allows you to look around the environment by physically moving your head. The display will follow whichever direction you move, giving you a 360-degree view of the virtual environment.
Some of these devices come with handheld controllers that track your hands' movements as well, providing for a more interactive experience.
 other type of headset houses your phone and uses its screen as the display. These don't require a computer and run completely off of apps on your smartphone. The graphics and performance levels on these headsets aren't quite as good as those with a built-in screen, but they do tend to be much cheaper


Augmented reality allows you to see the world around you with digital images layered on top of it. Augmented reality can also be used on devices like smartphones and laptops without the use of a headset. 

AR works by combining three key technologies:
•	Sensors: Sensors, such as cameras, GPS, and accelerometers, are used to track the user's position and orientation in the real world.
•	Computer vision: Computer vision algorithms are used to identify objects and features in the real world.
•	Graphics: Graphics software is used to render the computer-generated images that are overlaid on the real world.
When a user looks through an AR device, such as a smartphone or tablet, the sensors track their position and orientation. The computer vision algorithms then identify objects and features in the real world. The graphics software then renders the computer-generated images that are overlaid on the real world.

VR is created using a variety of technologies, including:
•	Head-mounted displays (HMDs): HMDs are the most common way to experience VR. They typically have a display screen that covers the user's eyes, and sensors that track the user's head and hand movements.
•	Spatial tracking: Spatial tracking is used to track the user's position and orientation in the virtual environment. This is done using a variety of sensors, such as cameras, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.
•	3D graphics: 3D graphics are used to create the virtual environment. This is done using a variety of software programs, such as game engines and 3D modeling software.
challenges of using AR/VR
•	Cost: VR headsets and software can be expensive.
•	Motion sickness: Some people experience motion sickness when using VR.
•	Eye strain: VR can cause eye strain if it is used for long periods of time.
•	Privacy: VR headsets can collect data about the user's environment and activities.
 challenges of using AR:
•	Hardware limitations: AR headsets and other devices are still in their early stages of development, and they often have limitations in terms of resolution, field of view, and battery life.
•	Content development: Creating high-quality AR content is a time-consuming and expensive process.
•	User experience: AR can be disorienting for some users, and it can be difficult to interact with AR content in a natural way.
•	Privacy and security: AR devices can collect data about the user's environment and activities, which raises privacy and security concerns.
•	Adoption: AR is still a relatively new technology, and it is not yet clear how widely it will be adopted by consumers and businesses.




Both VR and AR technologies are growing at a pretty rapid pace. Many experts predict that they'll continue to become more and more popular in the near future. As technology becomes more advanced, it'll be exciting to see how they'll be applied to both business and everyday life!
